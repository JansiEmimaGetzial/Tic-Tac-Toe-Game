# Tic Tac Toe Game - Java

## Overview

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Java. The game is developed using a TicTacToe class, providing a text-based interface for two players.

## Features

- *Board Representation:* The game board is created using the printBoard() method, utilizing a 3x3 matrix (board[row][col]).
  
- *Game Logic:* The game uses a while loop with the condition (!gameOver) to continuously check for the winner. The winning conditions are verified by matching inputs diagonally, row-wise, and column-wise.

- *Winning Check:* The haveWon() method is implemented to check the user inputs and return true if a winning pattern is detected, otherwise, it returns false.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the TicTacToe.java file.
3. Follow on-screen instructions to make moves.
4. The game will announce the winner or declare a draw.
